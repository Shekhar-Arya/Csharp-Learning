Arthmatic operator
Operator	    Description	                                                    Example
+	            Adds two operands	                                            A + B = 30
-	            Subtracts second operand from the first	                        A - B = -10
*	            Multiplies both operands	                                    A * B = 200
/	            Divides numerator by de-numerator	                            B / A = 2
%	            Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division	    B % A = 0
++	            Increment operator increases integer value by one	            A++ = 11
--	            Decrement operator decreases integer value by one	            A-- = 9  */
